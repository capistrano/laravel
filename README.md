# Capistrano::Laravel

Deploy Laravel applications with Capistrano v3.*

## Installation

If managing your Capistrano deploy as a ruby project, add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'capistrano', '~> 3.0.0'
gem 'capistrano-laravel'
```

And then execute:

```shell
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```shell
gem install capistrano-laravel
```

## Setting up Capistrano

After installing Capistrano, you can use it to initialize a skeleton configuration. To setup Capistrano, please follow the documentation provided on their website:

http://capistranorb.com/documentation/getting-started/preparing-your-application/

This will generate the following files:

```
.
├── Capfile                # Used to manage Capistrano and its dependencies
├── config
│   ├── deploy
│   │   ├── production.rb  # Configuration for production environment
│   │   └── staging.rb     # Configuration for staging environment
│   └── deploy.rb          # Common configuration for all environments
└── lib
    └── capistrano
        └── tasks          # Customized Capistrano tasks for your project
```
